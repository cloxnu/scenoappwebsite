- How your information is used;
- With whom your information may be shared;

## What kinds of data are there, and what do we collect?

Data can be collected in three ways.

- Data collected automatically;
- Data you provide us; and
- Data collected by our partners The basis for collecting this data is “legitimate interest” under GDPR (Global Data Protection Regulation) and “to support internal operations of the app” under COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act). Any data collected is done solely for internal uses that are reasonably and directly related to your relationship with US, by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
